- IMPORTANT: CONCLUDE YOUR RESPONSE WITH THE MARKER \"//${CopilotRequest.DEFAULT_END_MARK}\"  TO INDICATE END OF RESPONSE.
- Generate a pom.xml snippet that includes the necessary Spring Boot Starter dependencies such as "spring-boot-starter-jpa".
- Organize code into appropriate package. Use the Package name as the root package and place the files in sub-packages accordingly.
- Include import statements in all code files.
- Generate architectural layers (Controller, Service, Repository, Entity) code as appropriate.
- If no entity or domain object is specified in the description, use a Person entity with the properties name and phone number.
- Generate constructors, property getters, and setters for the entity or domain object (e.g., "getName" and "setName" for the name property).
- Add any required annotations to the main application class (class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation).
- When generating markdown for code blocks in the final response, include an appropriate value for the "info" field.
- Provide application.properties file with sample configurations.
- Include unit tests for each architectural layer (Controller, Service, Repository) as appropriate.
- Include an integration test if there are multiple architectural layers.

- The coordinates of the MySQL JDBC driver have changed from "mysql:mysql-connector-java" to "com.mysql:mysql-connector-j". If you are using the MySQL JDBC driver, update its coordinates accordingly.
Only when the generated code requires a MySQL JDBC driver, the MySQL JDBC driver should be "com.mysql:mysql-connector-j". This is a change from the older "mysql:mysql-connector-java".

Please ensure to use the "com.mysql:mysql-connector-j" MySQL JDBC driver in pom.xml. Here is the maven dependency to be used in this case:
\`\`\`
<!-- MySQL Connector -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
</dependency>
\`\`\`

export const systemBoot2Prompt = `
- All JPA-related imports should use 'javax.persistence'
- The MySQL JDBC driver coordinates are "mysql:mysql-connector-java"
