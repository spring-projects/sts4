# VS Code Language Server for Spring Boot

VSCode extension and Language Server providing support for working with Spring Boot 
`application.properties`, `application.yml` and `.java` files.

# Usage:

The extension will automatically activate when you edit files with the following
name patterns:

 - `*.java` =>  activates Spring Boot specific support editing `.java` files.
 - `application*.properties` => activates support for Spring Boot properties in `.properties`format.
 - `application*.yml` =>  activates support for Spring Boot properties in `.yml` format.

You can also define your own patterns and map them to the language-ids
`spring-boot-properties` or `spring-boot-properties-yaml` by defining `files.associations`
in workspace settings.  See [vscode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/overview#_adding-a-file-extension-to-a-language) for details.

# Functionality for `.java`

## Navigating the source code - Go to symbol in file/workspace
Easy navigation to Spring-specific elements of your source code.

![Go to Symbol in workspace][java-navigation]

### Shortcuts
* Mac: Cmd-Shift-O (symbols in file), Cmd-T (symbols in workspace)
* Linux/Windows: Ctrl-Shift-O (symbols in file), Ctrl-T (symbols in workspace)

### Examples
* `@/` shows all defined request mappings (mapped path, request method, source location)
* `@+` shows all defined beans (bean name, bean type, source location)
* `@>` shows all functions (prototype implementation)
* `@` shows all Spring annotations in the code

## Quick-access for running apps
Easy navigation to the provided request mappings of running apps.

![accessing running apps quickly][java-live-apps-quick-access]

### Shortcuts
* Mac: Cmd-Shift-O (symbols in file), Cmd-T (symbols in workspace)
* Linux/Windows: Ctrl-Shift-O (symbols in file), Ctrl-T (symbols in workspace)

### Examples
* `//` shows all request mappings of all running Spring Boot apps and opens a browser for the selected endpoint

## Live application information hovers
The Spring Tools 4 can connect to running Spring processes to visualize internal information of those running Spring processes inline with your source code. This allows you to see, for example, which beans have bean created at runtime, how they are wired, and more.

The Spring Tools 4 shows hints by highlighting sections of source code with a light green background. Hovering over the highlights with the mouse pointer, data from the running app is displayed in a popup.

For some types of information, STS 4 may also show a 'quick summary' as a codelens. Codelenses are only supported in Eclipse and Vscode at the moment, not in atom. For Eclipse this has to be enabled via *Preferences >> Language Servers >> Spring Language Servers >> Spring Boot Language Server*.

If there are multiple instances of the app running on your machine, the live data from all those instances will show up in the hover information.

![live data from running apps as hover on source code][java-live-hovers]

### Examples
* `@Profile`: shows information about the active profiles on the running apps
* `@Component`, `@Bean`, `@Autowired`: shows detailed information about the beans and their wiring from the live app
* `@ConditionalOn...`: shows information about the conditions and their evaluation at runtime

### Application Requirements for Spring Boot projects

Live information is scraped from running apps using JMX to connect to [Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html). This means that `spring-boot-actuator` must be added as a dependency to your application and enabled. The easiest way to accomplish this is to add the `spring-boot-actuator-starter` dependency to your application's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` as explained [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-enabling.html).

#### Spring Boot 2.2 and beyond

⚠️ The JMX versions of the actuator endpoints (which the tooling uses under the hood to retrieve live data from the running applications) is not enabled by default anymore since Spring Boot 2.2. In order to allow Spring Tools 4 to continue to visualize live data from the running applications, you need to start the boot app with `-Dspring.jmx.enabled=true` in order to activate the JMX endpoints.

### Managing Live Data Connections

Press `CTRL-SHIFT-P` (or `CMD-SHIFT-P` on Mac) and select the command to
"Manage Live Spring Boot Process Connections". A choice of actions to connect/refresh/disconnect
to local processes found on your machine will then be presented.

## Code templates

Write Spring code with templates, available via regular code completion.

### Examples

* `@GetMapping`
* `@PostMapping`
* `@PutMapping`

## Smart code completions
Additional code completions for Spring-specific annotations

![Smart code completion for boot properties][java-code-completion]

### Examples
* `@Value`: code completion for Spring Boot property keys
* `@Scope`: code completion for standard scope names

# Functionality for `.properties` and `.yml`

This extension analyzes your project's classpath and parses and indexes any [Spring Boot
Properties Metadata](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/configuration-metadata.html) it finds. Both Maven and Gradle projects are supported.

The data in the index is used to provide validation, code completions and information
hovers while editing Spring Boot Properties in either `.properties` or `.yml` format.

## Validation

![application-yaml-validation][yaml-validation]
![application-properties-validation][properties-validation]

## Code Completions

![application-properties-completions][properties-completion]

## Information Hovers

![application-yaml-hovers][yaml-hovers]
